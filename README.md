# House-Price-Predictor

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a **Random Forest** model. The model is trained and evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.

## Introduction
The project implements a Random Forest model to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, area, and location.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter

# Example of loading data using pandas
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  

# Split into features and target
X = data.drop('price', axis=1)
y = data['price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train_prepared, X_test_prepared, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Initialize and train the Random Forest model
random_forest = RandomForestRegressor()
random_forest.fit(X_train_prepared, y_train)

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Make predictions and calculate RMSE
predictions = random_forest.predict(X_test_prepared)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))

print(f"Random Forest RMSE: {rmse}")

## Introduction
The project implements a Random Forest model to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, area, and location.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter
Dataset
The dataset contains various features of houses (e.g., size, number of rooms, location) and their corresponding prices. It is split into training and testing sets.

python
Copy code
# Example of loading data using pandas
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('house_prices.csv')  # Replace with actual dataset path

# Split into features and target
X = data.drop('price', axis=1)
y = data['price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train_prepared, X_test_prepared, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Modeling
We use a Random Forest Regressor to train on the prepared dataset.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Initialize and train the Random Forest model
random_forest = RandomForestRegressor()
random_forest.fit(X_train_prepared, y_train)
Evaluation
We use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Make predictions and calculate RMSE
predictions = random_forest.predict(X_test_prepared)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))

print(f"Random Forest RMSE: {rmse}")
Results
After training and evaluating the Random Forest model, the following RMSE was obtained:

Random Forest RMSE: 3.004
